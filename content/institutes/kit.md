KIT contributes to research areas A, C and D and is a partner for research package B.

The focus in area A lies on the development of tools for workflow management and
job scheduling in heterogeneous, distributed systems and on the development of
coordinated chaching schemes to for efficient access to data. The tools will be
tested with partners involved in area B. In area C, KIT researchers work on the
deployment of deep neural networks for fast simulation of particle showers in
calorimeters and in the atmosphere. Contributions in area D aim the development
and deployment of improved general packages for track fitting to particle traces
in complex particle detectors.
