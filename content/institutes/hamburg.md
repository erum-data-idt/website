University of Hamburg is contributing to research area C with two projects.
First, we investigate improved algorithms that combine tracking and calorimeter
measurements from LHC detectors with timing information for improved precision,
especially in the presence of a large number of simultaneous proton-proton
collisions (pile-up). For this we develop neural network architectures that
scale well and combine data from different sources. Secondly, we work to gain a
clearer understanding of the decision process of deep neural networks in a
physics context. Here we combine insight from physical variables with the latent
space representation of data inside neural networks. Beyond these topics, the
groups at UHH also work on other application of machine learning to particle
physics, such as the development of better high-level tagging algorithms as well
as model independent searches for new physics.
