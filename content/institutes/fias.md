The group at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS) is contributing
to research area C. We are developing machine- and deep-learning tools for the
CBM experiment, including data analysis and detector design. Deep Convolutional
Neural networks (DCNN) are applied to detect the QCD phase transition from
realistic simulations of the CBM experiment. Acceptance and efficiency
limitations of the detector will be considered in a hybrid simulation for heavy
ion collisions in CBM. In a final step the developed ML/DL tools can then be
used on real data within the CBMroot. Furthermore, both supervised and
unsupervised machine-learning techniques will be developed for fast physics
extraction and event class selection, which is important for the online
selection of 'interesting physics' events from the large event rate at the CBM
experiment.
