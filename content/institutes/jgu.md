The ETAP group at the physics department of the JGU is contributing in the research area C.

The contribution of the ETAP group is the replacement of existing algorithms for
the real time detection and reconstruction of physics objects by deep neural
networks. The group is targeting a processing rate of up to 40 MHz and a maximum
response time of less than a millionth of a second. This will be sufficient to
cover a large range of applications within the network. Field Programmable Gate
Arrays (FPGAs) are the ideal choice.

The challenge is to optimally adapt the neural networks to the architecture of
FPGAs, and the first trigger stage of the ATLAS experiment provides an ideal
test environment for this.
