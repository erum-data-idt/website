The RWTH-Aachen groups contribute to high-energy physics and
astroparticle experiments. They have substantial experience in grid
computing, data analysis, algorithm development, and machine learning.
As part of the ErUM Data pilot project, they are advancing digitisation
for physics research in all areas, including cloud techniques,
track-finding and a wide range of deep learning approaches, including
autonomous and unsupervised learning approaches.
