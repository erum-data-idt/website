The [Belle II](https://www.flavor.physik.uni-muenchen.de/) and [ATLAS](https://www.etp.physik.uni-muenchen.de/) groups at the [physics faculty](https://www.physik.uni-muenchen.de/) of the LMU are contributing in the research areas A, B, and C. The LMU is also coordinating the collaborative project.

In research area C we are addressing the problem of increasing demands for simulations. One approach is to avoid costy detector simulations by discarding events, that are later not selected in an analysis, already after the generation. Deep neural networks are employed for that task. Another approach is the generation of background data with GANs to avoid the handling of large background data sets.
