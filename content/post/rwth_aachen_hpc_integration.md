We are happy to announce that [COBalD/TARDIS](https://matterminers.github.io/) 
developed at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and funded within the 
scope of ErUM-Data IDT is now also used for the transparent, dynamic and 
on-demand integration of [CLAIX](https://www.itc.rwth-aachen.de/cms/IT-Center/Forschung-Projekte/High-Performance-Computing/~eucm/Infrastruktur/?lidx=1) 
HPC resources provided by the RWTH Aachen IT Center into the WLCG Tier 2 center
operated at the RWTH Aachen University.
