We are happy to announce that the 
[COBalD/TARDIS](https://matterminers.github.io/) team from the Karlsruhe 
Institute of Technology (KIT) and funded within the scope of ErUM-Data IDT set 
a new record this week. By transparently integrating an additional 10.000 CPU 
cores from the new [HoreKa](https://www.scc.kit.edu/en/services/horeka.php) 
supercomputer at the 
[Steinbuch Center for Computing](https://www.scc.kit.edu/en/index.php) (KIT) 
we currently provide around 20.000 cores to the CMS experiment. In other words 
we are almost tripling the CMS compute resources at [GridKa](http://gridka.de) 
for one week.
