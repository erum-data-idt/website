The project [COBalD/TARDIS](https://matterminers.github.io/) developed at the
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and funded within the scope of 
ErUM-Data IDT is supporting the fight against COVID-19. COBalD/TARDIS, 
otherwise used to dynamically provision and transparently 
integrate opportunistic resources for High Energy Physics, is currently 
acting as a job factory and submission infrastructure for work-units of the 
[Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/) and 
[Rosetta@Home](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/) projects at the GridKa Tier 1 
centre at KIT. [[SCC News]](http://www.scc.kit.edu/en/aboutus/13531.php)
