The large data rates and volumes that research projects of the next decade, in particular the HL-LHC, will deliver are challenging.
On May 6 and 7 the German community is invited to discuss how we can address these challenges.
The goal is to develop a common strategy for computing and software in Germany.
The agenda of the online workshop can be found on the [indico page](https://indico.physik.uni-muenchen.de/event/33/).
