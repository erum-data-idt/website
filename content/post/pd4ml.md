Scientist from particle physics, astroparticle physics, and hadron- and
nuclear physics have combined their datasets in a common, publicly
accessible [repository](https://github.com/erum-data-idt/pd4ml) to promote the development of overarching
machine learning solutions. A successful implementation of such a
solution is presented in a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00656) and at the [ML4Jets](https://indico.cern.ch/event/980214/contributions/4413659/) conference.
