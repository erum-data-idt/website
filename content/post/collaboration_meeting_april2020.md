Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic we replaced our collaboration meeting by
a remote meeting. The meeting focused on joint projects where multiple groups
work together on experiment overarching solutions. The agenda and slides can be
found at the [indico page](https://indico.physik.uni-muenchen.de/event/32/).

It was nice to see that the COBalD/TARDIS system developed by members of our
collaboration can contribute to fight COVID-19 by [running Folding@Home on
opportunistic resources](https://github.com/MatterMiners/FoldingAtHome).
