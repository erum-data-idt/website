<h3>II. General Information about Data Processing on the LMU Internet Pages</h3>
<h4>II.1 Applicability of the Data Protection Policy</h4>
<p>This data protection policy applies to the processing of personal data in connection with the LMU internet presence.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to Art. 4 item 1 DSGVO, &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; means all information which relates to an identified or identifiable, natural person; the term &ldquo;identifiable&rdquo; is deemed to mean a natural person who can be identified directly or indirectly, in particular through assignment of an identifier such as a name, an identifying number, location data, an online identity or one or several special features which are an expression of physical, physiological, genetic, psychic, financial, cultural or social identity of this natural person.</li>
<li>According to Art. 4 item 2 DSGVO, &ldquo;processing&rdquo; means any process executed with or without the aid of automated methods, or any such set of methods in connection with personal data, such as the collection, acquisition, organization, ordering, saving, adapting or changing, read-out, query, use, disclosure by means of transmittal, dissemination or any other form of manipulation, coordination or linking, limitation, deletion or destruction.</li>
</ul>
<h4>II.2 Purpose and Legal basis for processing of personal data</h4>
<p>In accordance with Art. 2 para. 6 BayHSchG, Art. 4 para. 1 lines 1 and 2 BayEGovG, on our web pages we offer our services and administrative services, and also information for the public about our activities. Personal data will only be processed on the LMU internet pages provided this is necessary to provide a functioning internet page, to present the particular content, or to provide certain services or offers. The processing of personal data occurs either owing to a legal requirement or based on the user&rsquo;s consent. When processing of personal data is based on a consent, then such processing shall occur based on Art. 6 para. 1 (a) DSGVO. Art. 6 para. 1 (b) DSGVO serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data required for the performance of a contract to which the user is a party. Insofar as processing personal data is required to fulfil a legal obligation to which the LMU is subject, the applicable legal basis is provided by Art. 6 para. 1 (c) DSGVO. In the event that the vital interests of the affected person or other natural person require the processing of personal data, the applicable legal basis is provided by Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e, para. 3 lit. b DSGVO i.V.m. Art. 4 para. 1 BayDSG. The processing may also be required in fulfillment of a mission which has been assigned to the LMU and which is in the public interest (Art. 6 para. 1 (b) DSGVO). Additional legal basis may also arise from special-legal or other legal regulations, to which reference is made in the particular, individual case.</p>
<p>We use cookies, protocol data files and web analysis tools to prepare business statistics, to implement organizational studies, to check or maintain our web services and to ensure network and information security according to Art. 6 para. 1 BayDSG, &sect; 13 para. 7 TMG, Art. 11 para. 1 BayEGovG. Insofar and inasmuch as the purpose of the processing is not adversely impacted, we will anonymize or pseudomize your personal data.</p>
<h4>II.3 Data Deletion and Retention Period</h4>
<p>The personal data of users of the LMU internet pages will be deleted or anonymised inasmuch as and provided the particular purpose of the retention has expired and there is no archiving requirement. Deletion or erasure of the data will also occur when a retention period as specified by the European or domestic legislature in EU regulations, laws or other specifications to which the LMU is subject, has expired, unless there is a requirement for continued retention of the data for completion of or fulfillment of a contract. If provided in the referenced regulation, retention for a longer period is possible.</p>
<h4>II.4 Data Security</h4>
<p>In order to protect your data in a reasonable and comprehensive manner during the processing, and in particular to protect against its transmittal, where necessary and with reference to the prior art, we use appropriate encryption techniques and secure technical systems (e.g. SSL/TLS).</p>
<h3>III. Specific Information on Data Processing on the LMU Internet Pages</h3>
<p>Every time you visit an LMU website, the LMU system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the accessing computer. In addition, we process your personal data to the extent you provide such data via the LMU internet pages. In the processing of your personal data we take into account in particular the principles of data protection relating to necessity, purpose, data minimizing, legality, correctness and integrity.</p>

The use of these functionalities can be turned off by making a setting in your browser program. By turning off this feature, the display of some elements, e.g. contact forms, video player or accordion may be adversely affected.</p>
<p>Sometimes cookies are placed merely due to a visit to the LMU internet, for example, to identify user-sessions, and also to configure the internet pages in a user-friendly manner. Cookies are text files that are stored on the Internet browser or by the Internet browser on the user's computer system. If a user visits an internet page, a cookie may be stored in the user's operating system. This cookie contains a unique character sequence that permits the browser to be specifically identified upon a subsequent visit to the internet page.</p>
<p>A session-ID is saved in the cookies for public offers exclusively for identification of the user-session (session-cookie). These session-cookies are automatically deleted at the end of your visit by closing your browser.<br>Cookies are stored on your computer and transmitted to the LMU internet page by your computer. Therefore, you as a user have full control over the use of cookies. You can deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies by changing the configuration of your Internet browser. Cookies that have already been saved can be deleted at any time. This can also occur automatically.</p>
<p>The saving of these cookies can be turned off at any time by making a corresponding setting in the internet browser; this can also be done automatically.</p>
<p>However, several elements of our internet pages require that the calling internet browser can also be identified even after a page-change. If cookies are deactivated for the LMU internet pages, it is possible that not all functions of the LMU internet pages can still be accessed.</p>
<p>The following services can only be used when the saving of cookies is allowed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web forms</li>

<li>All offers saved via the central authentication mechanism</li>
</ul>
<p>The transmission of flash-cookies cannot be disabled via the settings in your internet browser, but by changing the setting of the flash player.</p>
<h4>III.3 Use of Social Media Icons or Internet Links</h4>
<p>No automatic transmittal of your personal data occurs when using Social Media icons of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, etc. on the LMU internet pages. To prevent automatic data transmission to the vendor of social media, an internet link to these media is disabled on the internet pages of the LMU. For reasons of data security, active social media plugins are not used.</p>
<p>Our social media presence is a part of our publicity work. Our endeavor is to provide and to exchange information with specific target groups.</p>
<p>All our social media vendors are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield and are transparent to any person, so that a legally reasonable level of protection exists for personal data, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook, Inc. (<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&amp;status=Active" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&amp;status=Active</a>)</li>
<li>Twitter Inc. (<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TORzAAO&amp;status=Active" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TORzAAO&amp;status=Active</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h4>III.4 Use of RSS</h4>
<p>An RSS feed is a form of the classical newsletter that you can read either with your browser or with a special program (RSS reader). When we offer an RSS feed, we will use it to inform you about current events. A list of central RSS feeds is provided at <a href="//www.en.uni-muenchen.de/functions/rss/index.html" target="_blank" title="RSS-Feed">https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/funktionen/rss.</a></p>
<p>If personal data is collected within the scope of an application for an RSS feed, then this information will be processed exclusively for the purpose of performing the RSS, and will be deleted as soon as it is no longer needed, that is, either after you log off, or after cessation of the RSS.</p>
<h4>III.5 Protocols and Preparation of Logfiles</h4>
<p>Due to occurring security-related events, e.g. attempted hacking attacks, relevant access data will be saved for every access on all central hosted webpages. The LMU internet server is operated for the LMU by its IT department (<a href="//www.uni-muenchen.de/einrichtungen/zuv/uebersicht/dez_vi/index.html" target="_blank" title="Informations- und Kommunikationstechnik (Dezernat VI)">Department VI</a>), Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1, 80539 M&uuml;nchen, E-Mail: <a class="g-link-mail" href="mailto:it.internet@verwaltung-uni-muenchen.de" title="Send email to: it.internet@verwaltung-uni-muenchen.de">it.internet@verwaltung-uni-muenchen.de</a>).</p>
<p>Depending on the used access protocol, the protocol data set contains data with the following content:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP address for the inquiring computer</li>
<li>Date and time of the inquiry</li>
<li>Access method/function requested by the inquiring computer</li>
<li>Input values (file name etc.) transmitted by the inquiring computer.</li>
<li>Access status of the web server (data file transmitted, data file not found, command not executed, etc.).</li>
<li>Name of the requested data file</li>
<li>URL from which the file was requested/the desired function was initiated</li>
<li>Information on browser type</li>
<li>The user&rsquo;s operating system</li>
<li>Internet pages from which the user's system accessed the LMU internet page</li>
<li>Internet pages that are called from the LMU internet pages</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>a) Purpose of the protocol</strong></p>
<p>The saved data are used for purposes of identification and tracking of allowed access and of impermissible access attempts, for maintenance of the internet page functionality on the internet server, and - in anonymized form - for optimizing of the internet offering. Temporary saving of the IP address is also necessary in order to enable delivery of the LMU internet page to your computer. For this purpose the user&rsquo;s IP address must remain stored for the duration of the session. This data is not stored by the LMU together with other personal data.</p>
<p><strong>b) Retention period</strong></p>
<p>The recorded data are saved for a maximum of seven days and then deleted. A longer retention period may occur in an individual case, provided a violation related to security was discovered. Irrespective thereof, retention for an even longer period is possible. In such a case, your IP address will be deleted or scrambled so that an allocation to the calling client is no longer possible.</p>
<p><strong>c) Evaluation of the protocol</strong></p>
<p>Evaluation of the protocol occurs by the authorized employee of the IT department (<a href="//www.uni-muenchen.de/einrichtungen/zuv/uebersicht/dez_vi/index.html" target="_blank" title="Informations- und Kommunikationstechnik (Dezernat VI)">Department VI</a>), Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1, 80539 M&uuml;nchen, E-Mail: <a class="g-link-mail" href="mailto:it.internet@verwaltung-uni-muenchen.de" title="Send email to: it.internet@verwaltung-uni-muenchen.de">it.internet@verwaltung-uni-muenchen.de</a>) under contract with the LMU and observing the provisions of data protection law.</p>
<p>If the data is urgently required for maintenance of the internet page and the saving of the data in logfiles is required for operation of the internet page, then you will not be entitled to a right of objection.</p>
<h4>III.6 Contact Form and Use of Email</h4>
<p>You can contact the LMU via the LMU internet pages. Please use the contact form found on the particular internet page, or the email address mentioned on the internet page.</p>
<p><strong>a) Use of a contact form</strong></p>
<p>If you make use of the contact form to communicate with us, then the data provided in the particular input mask will be transmitted to the LMU and saved. Usually this data will pertain to the first and last name, and an email address. The specific data can be found in the particular contact form or in the particular reference to the facility responsible for the content of the particular internet page. Required fields, without which the inquiry cannot be processed, are identified as such in the contact form. We obtain your consent for data processing in the course of the submission process and include a reference to our privacy policy.</p>
<p>In addition to the data you provide, the following data is also stored at the time the message is sent:</p>
<p>On the application server:</p>
<ul>
<li>Referrer (URL from which the form was called up)</li>
<li>User&rsquo;s email address provided in the form</li>
<li>Receiver&rsquo;s email address for the form</li>
</ul>
<p>The personal data processed during the application process serve to prevent misuse of the contact form and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.</p>
<p>By using a contact form you will be informed about the data collected and about your particular rights.</p>
<p><strong>b) Use of an email address</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the contact form, it is also possible to send an email to an LMU email address provided for use of the particular internet page. If you send us an email, then your email address and the other data provided by you will only be used for correspondence with you, and will be saved only as long as necessary for this purpose, unless some other legal grounds will justify its continuing retention.</p>
<p>Please note that the use of a non-encrypted email is fundamentally unsecure, that is, it may possibly be read, changed or captured by third parties along the transmission route. Please remember this when you send us information in an email. Therefore the sending of confidential messages should be either by regular mail or by S/MIME (X509-) encryption.</p>
<p>In the event that you wish to send us an encrypted message, please use the public X509-certificate for encryption of your message.</p>
<p>In order that we may also send you confidential messages, please also give us your postal address, if requested. Otherwise there is the possibility that no information can be shared.</p>
<p>In the event that you want to send us a non-encrypted email, then please use preferably a function address at the LMU, provided such an address is provided on the internet page.</p>
<p>Please note that in the case of an email inquiry, we cannot verify your identity and do not know who is concealed behind the email address. A legally secure communication by means of a simple, unsigned email is not ensured, not even if it is encrypted.</p>
<p>At the LMU we sometimes use filters against unwanted advertising (spam filters) that can also sometimes wrongly classify and delete emails as advertising. Emails that can contain harmful programs, e.g. viruses, are deleted automatically.</p>
<p>If you want to receive an encrypted email from us, then please provide us with the necessary information.</p>
<h4>III.7 Collection of Other Personal Data, e.g. Newsletter Subscription</h4>
<p>It is possible to input your personal data on the LMU internet pages. Your data basically will be encrypted (https) along the transmission route, unless the particular offers specifically make reference thereto.</p>
<p>If personal data is collected for a newsletter subscription, then it will be processed only for the purpose of sending you the newsletter. The particular newsletter can be canceled at any time. To do so, please use the email address oder website provided for the person responsible for sending the newsletter. Additional information will be provided together with your subscription to the newsletter.</p>
<h4>III.8 Google Custom Search</h4>
<p>The search field on this webpage (&ldquo;Google Custom Search&rdquo;) is provided by Google Inc. (&ldquo;Google&rdquo;). The use of this search field, where personal data is also transmitted to Google, is governed by the Google Data Protection Regulations (at <a href="https://www.google.de/privacy.html" target="_blank">www.google.de/privacy.html</a>). Your data will be transmitted when you send the form. If you do not want to accept these foreign data protection regulations, then please refrain from using the search function.</p>
<h4><a name="google-maps"></a>III.9 Use of embedded Google maps</h4>
<p>Some of the LMU internet pages use the Google Maps service. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. The referral occurs exclusively by means of an API (two-click method). The data will only be sent to Google by this program interface after you click on the &ldquo;Switch to Google Maps&rdquo; button.</p>
<p>When using the Google functions, Google will process your IP address and possibly other personal data (e.g. information about your use of this internet page or subsequent pages or the data offered in Google Maps). Google thus obtains information that you have called up our internet page or the corresponding subsequent pages. This information is usually sent to and saved on a Google server in the USA. This will occur independently of whether Google has set up a user account that you have requested, or whether no user account exists at all. If you are logged in to Google, your data will probably be assigned directly to your user account. If you do not want this data to be assigned to your profile at Google, then you must first log off your user account at Google before you switch to Google Maps. But Google will save your data (even for users not logged on or registered) as a user profile and will evaluate this data for their own internal purposes for advertising, market research and needs-based structuring of their internet pages, and may also inform other users of the social network about your activities on our internet page.</p>
<p>You have a right to object to the formation of this usage profile; to exercise this right you must apply directly and exclusively to Google. The LMU as provider of our internet pages has no influence on this data processing. If you do not agree to the transfer of your personal data to Google, then do not click on &ldquo;Switch to Google Maps.&rdquo; Then no data will be transferred to Google, however, a map will also not be opened.</p>
<p>Your personal data will only be collected and transferred to Google by our internet page if you click on the button &ldquo;Continue to Google Maps.&rdquo; The use of Google Maps is not absolutely necessary to obtain information about our internet pages and is thus voluntary for you. The incorporation of Google Maps into our internet pages occurs in the interest of a responsive presentation of our internet offers and to ensure a fast and convenient finding of sites available on our internet pages. This represents a justifiable interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 f) GDPR. In addition, Google Inc. is certified under the EU-US &ldquo;Privacy Shield&rdquo; Data Protection Agreement, whereby Google ensures a level of data protection equivalent to that of the EU in regard to data processing.</p>
